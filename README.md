Topping Generator For Ice Cream

## Inspiration
We wanted people to have the opportunity to try different ice cream toppings by creating a code that will choose a topping for an individual hands-free.

## What it does
it randomizes toppings of ice cream by generating a random number that is specific to a flavor of ice cream and visualizes the simulation of the toppings being chosen

## How we built it
We built the ice cream animation on Figma and the outlined task process. We coded a random number generator on Video Studio 2019 

## Challenges we ran into
Weâ€™re both beginner coders and learning code was exciting but also a bit difficult when connecting our ideas to what we wanted to implement. Though we did come up with a random generator we wanted to also add in variables of the toppings and different types of ice cream flavors. 


## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Some, accomplishments we are proud of is that we were able to learn a new skill on Figma animation that enables us to show that random selection of toppings. Flor is a bioengineer major and she is proud that she is able to step out of her element and have fun creating a code that ultimately gives her the opportunity to participate in a project. Zakiya is very supportive of Flor by sharing her knowledge with her and working together side by side on this inspiring project.


## What we learned
We learned to work as a team by communicating and sharing ideas with one another to create a project. We learned to use Figma Professional Plan which was a new website we were able to successfully use in our project.  Zakiya was able to teach Flor how to code C++ for the first time. 

## What's next for Automatic Toppings Generation For Ice Cream
Our plan is to broaden our code and add variables of ice cream flavors. We also plan on creating a survey that we can share in our university that can identify what are the best topping flavors majority of people would like to try.
